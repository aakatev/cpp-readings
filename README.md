# cpp-readings

Reading structured text data using c++14 std library. Based on example from [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html).

## Building and running

Compile with your favorite c++ compiler supporting c++14. Run executable.

For example, if you have bash and linux:

```
g++ main.cpp && ./a.out && rm ./a.out
```
